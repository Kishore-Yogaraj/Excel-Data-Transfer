# Excel_Data_Transfer
This program moves data from a specified cell in a source excel file to a specified cell in a destination excel file whenever the source cell is changed/updated

## Inspiration For the Application

During my internship with Magna, a leading mobility technology company, I had the privilege of working with the General Motors team and managing a variety of tasks. One of my key responsibilities was managing the company's inventory trackers using Excel files, which needed to be updated on a weekly basis with the quantities of parts received and required for the next shipment. However, I noticed a problem with the EDI list, which is the master Excel sheet provided by General Motors - the quantities for the 82 different parts were constantly changing, making it difficult for the team to accurately track the required parts.

To solve this problem, I took the initiative to create a Python program that enables a user to pair a cell from the source file (EDI list) to a cell in the destination file (inventory tracker). This innovative solution ensures that every time the source cell changes, the destination cell will automatically adjust accordingly. This means that the inventory tracker can now be kept 100% accurate, without the need for manual inputting of required quantities.

With this program in place, the entire engineering team can now easily keep track of which parts need to be run in the cell or put into press. This not only saves time and effort but also greatly improves the efficiency and accuracy of the entire inventory management process. Overall, I am proud to have contributed to Magna's success by creating a tool that streamlines their inventory management system, and enhances the accuracy and efficiency of the entire process.
